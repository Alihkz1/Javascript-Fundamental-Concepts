Yes — unobserving an image (or any element) using IntersectionObserver.unobserve() has several practical benefits, especially for performance and memory management.

✅ Benefits of Unobserving an Image
1. Performance Optimization
If you're observing many images (e.g., in a gallery or infinite scroll), keeping all of them observed after they've already loaded or triggered an action is wasteful.

unobserve() stops tracking that element, so the browser stops checking it on every scroll or resize.

2. Memory Management
Keeping observers alive unnecessarily can increase memory usage, especially on mobile devices.

Unobserving helps garbage collection clean up DOM references earlier.

3. Avoiding Redundant Triggers
Once an image has been lazy-loaded or animated, you don’t want it to trigger the callback again.

Unobserving ensures that the callback only runs once (e.g., the first time an image enters the viewport).

4. Cleaner Logic
Your logic becomes more predictable when you explicitly unobserve things you’re done with.
